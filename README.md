# Gypsilab
The gypsilab project is a young open-source MATLAB toolbox for fast numerical computation with finite element and boundary element methods. Accessible with a high-level programming language, it gives a useful framework for fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical acoustics, multiphysics problems can now be addressed.

   Gypsilab is divided in five parts :
 
 - <b> OpenFEM </b> : Library for Finite Element Method.
</br> <i>By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) and François Alouges (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b> OpenHmX </b>  : Library for H-Matrix computation and algebra.
 </br> <i> By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b> OpenMSH </b>  : Library for mesh management and numerical quadrature.
 </br> <i> By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b>NonRegressionTest</b> : Scripts for non regression testing. Useful to evaluate
 performance and verify computation.
 
 - <b>Problems</b> : Scripts with standard problems to take a first step in gypsilab.
